Note â€” this program is a *calculator*. It does not actually analyse a circuit to derive
formulas of elements. In this distribution, a specific CE amplifier circuit was analyzed
by the author who put in all the derived formulas. Then the program calculates them based
on given/known values and assumptions. This program is released with the hope that it
might inspire others to solve problems with the aid of computers and potentially provide
a basis for a different analysis.
